# SnapAdmin - Auth Test project

This is a sample project containing a blueprint on how to implement a Spring Security configuration for [SnapAdmin](https://github.com/aileftech/snap-admin).

This repo contains:
 * A basic Spring Boot app with entity definitions and an `import.sql` file that creates a sample database, including users and roles
 * End-to-end tests performed with Selenium on the SnapAdmin web interface, to check that the routes are protected properly

## üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin running this project, please ensure that you have the following software and tools installed:

### [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
Apache Maven is a powerful project management and build automation tool. It is used for building and managing Java projects, including this one.

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
It's not mandatory to have Docker installed, but for ease of use we provide a docker-compose file that will start a MySQL instance. If you don't want
to use Docker, you will need to customize the `application.properties` file in order to connect to your own database.


## üõ†Ô∏è Run the Program

  - Clone the Repository.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aileftech/snap-admin-test
    ```
  - Navigate to the Repository Folder.

    ```sh
    cd snap-admin-test
    ```
  - Create & Run Docker Container: 
        
    ```sh
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
    ```

    If you decided not to use Docker, check the `application.properties` file and configure the datasource properly. You can also use an H2
    embedded database which doesn't require starting a server.

  - Run the following command in the terminal: 

    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run or 'mvn spring-boot:start' to run in background.
    ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Accessing Admin Panel

Once the application is up and running, you can access the admin interface by opening your web browser and navigating to the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/admin](http://localhost:8080/admin)

You will be prompted with a login screen


## üìù Tests

To execute the tests for this application, make sure the application is running, and then run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
mvn test
```

Make sure you are running on a "clean" instance of the database, i.e. you have not changed its content as it could otherwise interfere with the
correct execution of the tests.
