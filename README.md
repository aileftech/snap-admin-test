# SnapAdmin Test Projects

This repo contains multiple [SnapAdmin](https://github.com/aileftech/snap-admin)-related projects. 

In particular, each folder is a stand-alone project consisting of a Spring Boot + SnapAdmin application.
Every project serves a dual purpose:

 * **Documentation**: the sample code is documented and can be used as a reference to implement specific 
   features/behaviours of SnapAdmin;
 * **Testing**: if applicable, each project also contains tests related to the main focus of the project

At the moment, these projects are available:

* **main**: The main project shows how to use most of the features and also contains
most of the tests. A slight variation of this code is used to power the live demo.

* **auth**: A sample projects which includes the implementation of a Spring Security
configuration to protect SnapAdmin with authentication/authorization.


## How to run

The following procedure can be used to run any individual project. Each project has its own README as well,
where additional information is available if necessary.

### üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, please ensure that you have the following software and tools installed:

#### [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
Apache Maven is a powerful project management and build automation tool. It is used for building and managing Java projects, including this one.

#### [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
It's not mandatory to have Docker installed, but for ease of use we provide a docker-compose file that will start a MySQL instance. If you don't want
to use Docker, you will need to customize the project's `application.properties` file in order to connect to your own database. 


### üõ†Ô∏è Run the Program

  - Clone the Repository.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aileftech/snap-admin-test
    ```

  - Navigate to the project folder inside the repo, e.g. 'auth'

    ```sh
    cd snap-admin-test/auth
    ```

  - Create & Run Docker Container: 
        
    ```sh
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
    ```

    If you decided not to use Docker, check the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and configure the datasource properly. You can also use an H2
    embedded database which doesn't require starting a server.

  - Run the following command in the terminal (inside the project's folder): 

    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run or 'mvn spring-boot:start' to run in background.
    ```

### üñ•Ô∏è Accessing Admin Panel

Once the application is up and running, you can access the admin interface by opening your web browser and navigating to the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/admin](http://localhost:8080/admin)

### üìù Tests

To execute the project-specific tests, run the following command inside the project's directory. Make sure the project's application is already running
in the background.

```shell
mvn test
```

Also, make sure you are running tests on a "clean" instance of the database, i.e. you have not changed its content. If that's the case, tests
may not execute correctly.
