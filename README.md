# SnapAdmin Test Projects

This repo contains multiple [SnapAdmin](https://github.com/aileftech/snap-admin)-related projects. 

Each folder contains a project consisting of a Spring Boot + SnapAdmin application, which serves a dual purpose:

 * **Documentation**: the sample code is documented and can be used as a reference to show how to
   implement specific features/behaviours of SnapAdmin;
 * **Testing**: if applicable, each project also contains tests related to the specific focus of the project

At the moment, these are the available projects:

* snapadmin-test: The main SnapAdmin project which shows how to use most of the features and also contains
most of the tests. Also used to power the live demo.

* snapadmin-recipe-auth: A sample SnapAdmin projects which includes the implementation of a Spring Security
configuration to protect SnapAdmin with authentication/authorization.

Each project has its own README containing detailed instructions on how to run and test.
