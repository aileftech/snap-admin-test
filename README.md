# SnapAdmin Test Projects

This repo contains multiple SnapAdmin-related projects. Each folder contains a project consisting of
a Spring Boot app using SnapAdmin, serving a dual purpose:
 * **Documentation**: the sample code is documented and can be used as a reference to show how to
   implement specific features/behaviours of SnapAdmin
 * **Testing**: if applicable, each project also contains tests related to the specific focus of the project


At the moment, these are the available projects:

* snapadmin-test

* snapadmin-recipe-auth
